## FLK Chess Engine
I'm building with my friend @sammas41 (github handle) an heuristic chess engine in C++.
We built from scratch the chessboard representation, searching and evaluation algorithms.
As of September 2024 the first release is available, we are still working on improving the performances
at least until the limits of heuristic chess engines allow us ðŸ¤”... Later on we will build also a deep learning version.

Code available at: https://github.com/Sammas41/FLK-Chess-Engine
