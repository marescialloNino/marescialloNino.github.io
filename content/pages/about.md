Hi, I'm Nicola.
In this website I share all things that I find interesting, I'm trying to write more about these things.

I work as quant developer in a small company in Paris.

I'm currently attending the Master of Science in Mathematical Engineering at the University of Padua and Financial Engineering at ESILV in Paris, I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and i worked almost two years as a software developer.

I'm trying to learn French.
