Hi, I'm Nicola.
In this website I share things about me and things that I find interesting, I'm trying to write more about these things.
Opinion shared are my own, sometimes just not very well thought but honest, this website is mainly for my own reference, so excuse any bad writing, bad phrasing, bad takes etc., I'm just writing something 🙂

I like reading books, dogs, coding my own projects (every 3 months a new one, abandoning the previous one), mathematics, games/puzzles and sports (especially football).

I work and live in Paris.

I just finished the Master of Science in Mathematical Engineering at the University of Padua and Financial Engineering at ESILV in Paris, I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

I've worked two years as a software developer and one yer as a "quant", wetheaver that means.

I'm trying to learn French and I'm not really good at it.
