Hi, I'm Nicola.
In this website I share things about me and things that I find interesting, I'm trying to write more about these things.
I'm doing this because i think that sharing what i think is a good way of challenging it, because when you take out your thoughts into words, you're forced to think about it more, in a way that other people can understand it.
My thoughts sometimes will not be very well thought, but this website is mainly for my own reference, so excuse any bad writing, bad phrasing, bad takes etc., I'm just writing something 🙂

I like reading books, dogs, coding my own projects (every 3 months a new one, abandoning the previous one), mathematics, games/puzzles and sports (especially football).

I work and live in Paris.

I just finished the Master of Science in Mathematical Engineering at the University of Padua and Financial Engineering at ESILV in Paris, I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

I've worked two years as a software engineer and as a "quant", wetheaver that means.

I'm trying to learn French and I'm not really good at it.
